# User Management Table

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a user management table using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **TypeScript**. The table fetches user information from an API and includes local filtering functionality, with a focus on managing state using Redux, ensuring type safety, and creating a clean, responsive design.

## Features
- **User Management Table**: Displays user information (name, username, email, and phone) fetched from an API.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Allows users to filter the table by name, username, email, and phone, with real-time updates as input is provided.
- **Redux State Management**: Uses Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety throughout the application to reduce potential runtime errors.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout scales well across different device sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Jest Testing**: Includes unit tests using Jest to ensure the functionality works as expected.
